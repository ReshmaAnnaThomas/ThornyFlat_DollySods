# Steps to run heimdall+fetch of Thorny Flats or Dolly Sods.

Copy and paste the `submit_script.sh`, edit the lines and submit with `sbatch submit_script.sh`. May you find lots of FRBs! 

Submit_script.sh will submit a slurm job to a GPU node. 

There are several singularity containers available on Thorny Flats and Dolly Sods. On Dolly Sods you also have `/shared/containers/tpp/tpp_20231212.sif` container. 

Both these containers `your` package and `Fetch`.
